## 🏨 HOSTEL MANAGEMENT

A hot-fixed version after the deployment, now the website is ready for the publishment ✨

## 🛠️ Changes made

- Change from using cookie to use the localStorage instead ( avoiding CORS atm ...)
- Use google cloud storage instead of the local storage one

## 📔 Note

- The version that is in the master branch still working for a local-development testing
- This is the hot-fixed version that make things work as expected just like in the master branch by changing the storage and how we store the token
